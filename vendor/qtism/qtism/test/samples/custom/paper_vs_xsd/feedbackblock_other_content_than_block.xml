This file aims at testing/exploring the rupture between the "paper based specification"* and the IMS QTI 2.1 XML
Schema Definition. Indeed, the "paper based specification" describes the feedbackBlock as containing block components.

Unfortunately, in the IMS QTI 2.1 XML Schema Definition, the feedbackBlock class can contain elements out of the set defined 
by the block class.

This test file focuses on creating a feedbackBlock containing other QTI classes than the one described in the "paper based specification"
and see what happens with loading this file with and without the the XML Schema Validation.

FYI, the XSD of IMS QTI 2.1 allow the following QTI classes to be direct children of feedbackBlock:

positionObjectStage (block)
customInteraction (block)
drawingInteraction (block)
gapMatchInteraction (block)
matchInteraction (block)
graphicGapMatchInteraction (block)
hotspotInteraction (block)
graphicOrderInteraction (block)
selectPointInteraction (block)
graphicAssociateInteraction (block) 
sliderInteraction (block)
choiceInteraction (block)
mediaInteraction (block)
hottextInteraction (block)
orderInteraction (block)
extendedTextInteraction (block)
uploadInteraction (block)
associateInteraction (block)
feedbackBlock (block)
templateBlock (block)
infoControl (block)
math (block)
include (block)
pre (block)
h1 (block)
h2 (block)
h3 (block)
h4 (block)
h5 (block)
h6 (block)
p (block)
address (block)
dl (block)
ol (block)
hr (block)
ul (block)
blockquote (block)
table (block)
div (block)
img (inline)
br (inline)
object (flow, inline)
em (inline)
a (inline)
code (inline)
span (inline)
sub (inline)
acronym (inline)
big (inline)
tt (inline)
kbd (inline)
q (inline)
i (inline)
dfn (inline)
abbr (inline)
strong (inline)
sup (inline)
var (inline)
small (inline)
samp (inline)
b (inline)
cite (inline)
templateInline (inline)
feedbackInline (inline)
printedVariable (inline)

It seems that, at a runtime point of view, the content of feedbackBlocks must be extdended to flow to cover all these QTI classes.
Unfortunately, accept flow elements will include other unexpected elements to the possible list of feedbackBlock direct children candidates,
that should not appear directly into a feedbackBlock.

+ hottext
+ rubricBlock
+ endAttemptInteraction
+ inlineChoiceInteraction
+ textEntryInteraction

So we'll have to find an agreement :) !
