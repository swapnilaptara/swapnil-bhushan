This file aims at testing/exploring the rupture between the "paper based specification"* and the IMS QTI 2.1 XML
Schema Definition. Indeed, the "paper based specification" describes the templateBlock as containing blockStatic components.

Unfortunately, in the IMS QTI 2.1 XML Schema Definition, the templateBlock class can contain elements out of the set defined 
by the blockStatic class.

This test file focuses on creating a templateBlock containing other QTI classes than the one described in the "paper based specification"
and see what happens with loading this file with and without the the XML Schema Validation.

FYI, the XSD of IMS QTI 2.1 allow the following QTI classes to be direct children of templateBlock:

+ pre (block)
+ h1 (h1)
+ h2 (h2)
+ h3 (h3)
+ h4 (h4)
+ h5 (h5)
+ h6 (h6)
+ p (block)
+ address (block)
+ dl (block)
+ ol (block)
+ ul (block)
+ br (inline)
+ hr (block)
+ img (inline)
+ object (flowStatic, inlineStatic)
+ blockquote (blockquote)
+ em (inline)
+ a (inline)
+ code (inline)
+ span (inline)
+ sub (inline)
+ acronym
+ big
+ tt (inline)
+ kbd (inline)
+ q (inline)
+ i (inline)
+ dfn (inline)
+ abbr (inline)
+ strong (inline)
+ sup (inline)
+ var (inline)
+ small (inline)
+ samp (inline)
+ b (inline)
+ cite (inline)
+ table (block)
+ div (block, flowStatic)
+ math (blockStatic, flowStatic, inlineStatic)
+ templateBlock (blockStatic, flowStatic)
+ templateInline (inline)
+ feedbackBlock (block)
+ feedbackInline (inline)
+ printedVariable (inline, flowStatic, textOrVariable) i.e. text (the complexType is mixed).

It seems that, at a runtime point of view, the content of templateBlocks must be extdended to flowStatic to cover all these QTI classes.
Unfortunately, accept flowStatic elements will include other elements to the possible list of rubricBlock direct children candidates,
that should not appear directly into a rubricBlock.

+ hottext
+ rubricBlock
+ infoControl

So we'll have to find an agreement :) !

				Hello there, regarding the paper based specification, I cannot be contained
				directly into a rubricBlock. However, the XML Schema Definition describes
				the rubricBlock complexType as a "mixed" one. So I am perfectly allowed to be there.
				<!-- This hr element is allowed to be there from both XSD and paper spec point of views. -->
				<hr/>
				<div>
					This div and its inner text are perfectly valid from both XSD and paper spec point of views.
